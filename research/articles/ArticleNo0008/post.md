The following challenge page frames an inner.html page that is vulnerable to XSS. Frame the inner.html page from an attacker page and get JavaScript execution inside of it. Try not to share solutions too publicly. In one week, a writeup will be published and a second challenge will be released. A week after that a writeup for the second challenge will be released, as well as a writeup on a vulnerability in an open source library that uses the relevant ideas here to achieve XSS.
